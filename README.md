# Features

## Audio control removal
Don't want to be fully in control of your audio? Well just click that box and you'll be stuck with whatever the volume was last, or whatever you set your default volume to be!

## Auto rating and comments!
Too busy gaming? Or maybe you fell asleep? Well with this handy feature, if your wallpaper doesn't change before an invisible timer runs out, then a personality of your choice will rate the image ***just for you!***

<br>Personalities are as follows:
<li>Kind/Auto-liker</li>
This personality is less of an actual personality and more of a 'I generally like everything so I don't care too much if this bot likes things for me' deal.
<br>
<li>Dom</li>
This one uses explitives and talks down about you while thanking whoever set your wallpaper
<br>
<li>Pet Owner</li>
This personality is more cutesy, as a pet owner wouldn't be mean when talking about their cute pet ya know?
<br>
<li>4th wall breaker/Funny</li>
This attempts humor, I 'unno I'm tired so they might not be as funny as I think at the time of writing this lmaoooo
<br>
<li>None</li>
This isn't a personality, just a way to let whoever set your image that you're busy at the moment by saying "Sorry! I must be busy and can't rate wallpapers at the moment!"
